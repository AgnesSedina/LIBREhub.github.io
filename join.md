### We are hiring!

Are you as enthusiastic about open source and science technology as we are? Are you available for a job in a dynamic research environment? Then this Technology Fellow position could be of your interest:

The [Institute for Biological and Medical Engineering (IIBM)](https://ingenieriabiologicaymedica.uc.cl/en/) of the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile is currently looking for a professional to develop hardware prototypes and workshops related to open source bio-microscopy and similar instruments. The position is available as part of the project "Latin American Center for Bioimaging through Open Hardware" (LIBRE hub) led by Tobias Wenzel, Pablo Irarrázaval, and Vicente Parot. This project is funded for 3 years by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. Its objective is to contribute to the Latin American academic community by expanding access to technology for bioimaging, including medical imaging and sample manipulation. The results of the project include the development of workshops, seminars, and networking around the topic of open source hardware.

What would you do?
- Build prototypes of laboratory instruments from the open source literature, and improve their documentation, including quality control of their respective translations.
- Prepare and execute, together with the project researchers, Open Hardware workshops to train scientists in Chile and Latin America in open source bioimaging instrumentation.
- Manufacture parts and purchase materials related to the development of equipment for the workshops, as well as assistance and coordination with the attendants of the
workshops.
- Develop modified prototypes that can be used for workshops to teach the construction and use of research grade bioimaing open hardware.
- Coordination and networking with the team and international tutors.

The full-time work will be performed in person at the IIBM, San Joaquin campus of Pontifical Catholic University in Santiago de Chile, starting in September 2022.

What experience is required?
- Knowledge in the following areas: digital fabrication, especially 3d printing, and some Python or Arduino programming experience. Knowledge of electronics, other digital fabrication methods and advanced programming is desirable but not required.
- A prior experience in building some kind of machine or instrument, from instructions or self-designed.
- Motivation to learn new things.
- Support for Open Source and detailed documentations.
- Interdisciplinary communication skills in Spanish and English in an academic context.
- A graduate degree would be desirable.

We are interested in recruiting those seeking to make a contribution to our community through the development of our project. **To apply to this 2 1/2 year position, please send both a curriculum vitae and a motivation letter to librehub@uc.cl by September 22nd.**

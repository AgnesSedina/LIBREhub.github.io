#### Speaker:
*Weijian Zong* holds a BSc in Electrical Engineering from Peking University. He obtained his PhD in 2017, focusing on developing imaging technologies for neuroscience. He is currently a researcher in the Moser group at Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience. In the past few years, He led the development of three versions of miniature 2P microscopes (i.e. 2P miniscope) to record neuronal activity in freely-moving rodents (Zong et al, Nature Methods 2017; Nature Methods 2021; and Cell 2022). Besides the miniature 2P microscopes, He also developed a series of other advanced fluorescence imaging tools across broad topics. And Dr. Zong's current research is developing an all-optical approach for characterizing functional connectivity in the medial entorhinal cortex.

Dr. Zong holds 6 invention patents in optical and imaging. His work on developing the new generation of miniature two-photon microscopes was selected as China's top 10 scientific achievements in 2017.  Dr. Zong received Shitsan Pai Award for Young Biophysicists Award in 2017 and became a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie fellowship in 2019.
